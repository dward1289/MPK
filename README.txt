Final Feature List
==================
- Custom ListView
  The custom list view allows the user to view
  Pokemon that have been added to their Captured List.
  The custom list view displays information about the Pokemon, and 
  allows the user to delete the Pokemon by tapping a Pokemon from the list.
  
- ActionBar
  The action bar is the main navigation for this application. The action bar
  makes it easy for the user to navigate through the application.
  
- DatePicker
  Instead of having the user type in the date, the user can select the date
  by using the date picker. The date picker will display the current date by 
  default.
  
- Share
  The user will be able to share the Pokemon they've caught with their friends
  by using the share button located in the Action Bar. The user can also share
  their Profile Card with their friends, and ask them to battle.
  
- Avatars
  If the user doesn't want to use their personal pictures as a profile photo, the
  user can select one of the nine custom made avatars.

- Spinners
  There are a total of 600+ Pokemon. Instead of having the user look through all
  of the Pokemon, the spinners keep the Pokemon sorted by type. The first spinner 
  allows the user to select the Pokemon type. The second spinner finds all of the 
  Pokemon that are the selected type and populates with the name of Pokemon.
